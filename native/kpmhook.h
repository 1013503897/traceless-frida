 * libkpmhook: userspace glue that maps LSPlant's InitInfo inline-hook callbacks
 * onto the stealth KPM (shpte) via the no-superkey syscall bridge.
 *
 * kpm_inline_hooker(target, hooker) == LSPlant InlineHookFunType. It UXN-traps the
 * target's whole code page (multi-page `pghook` table), routes every instruction
 * on that page through a position-independent whole-page DBI clone (lib/dbi), and
 * overrides the target's entry -> hooker. The returned `backup` is the in-clone
 * faithful copy of the target -- call it to run the original. Several targets on
 * the SAME page share one trapped page / clone (the KPM appends overrides), which
 * is exactly what LSPlant needs (it inline-hooks ~20 libart funcs one at a time,
 * many sharing code pages).
 *
 * Prerequisite (privileged, done out-of-band once per boot by shctl + superkey):
 *     shctl <KEY> load shpte.kpm
 *     shctl <KEY> control shpte probe
 *     shctl <KEY> control shpte bridge
 * After that this library needs NO superkey -- it drives the KPM as the injected
 * agent (e.g. Vector's native layer) through personality(BRIDGE_MAGIC, ...).
 *
 * Boundary (Layer-1): the whole-page clone assumes the hooked function body fits
 * inside its page. Functions whose body spans a page boundary need multi-page
 * clones (tracked as future hardening); page-isolated targets are fine today.
 *
 * Build: link lib/dbi.c. Not for kernel use (plain userspace + libc + libdbi).
